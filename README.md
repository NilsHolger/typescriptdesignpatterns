# simple modern typescript/javascript design patterns

we must learn the technologies forwards and backwards ... 
this is world class https://www.yearofmoo.com/ a model in humanity and technology :)
get inspired and build an app, then build another one ...
the family is together: node, javascript, v8, c++
recommended javascript engine client side, server side => v8 is on es7
to explore: investigate test driven development in javascript and unit testing
namaste friend
my soul honors your soul
i honor the place in you where
the entire universe resides.
i honor the light, love, truth,
beauty and peace within you,
because it is also within me.
in sharing these things
we are united, we are the same,
we are one.

Creational

1. Singleton
a class of which only a single instance can exist

2. Abstract factory
create an instance of several families of classes

3. Factory method
creates an instance of several derived classes

4. Builder
separates object construction from its representation

5. Prototype
a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

Structural

1. Adapter
match interfaces of different classes

2. Bridge
separates an object's interface from its implementation

3. Composite
a tree structure of simple and composite objects

4. Decorator
add responsibilities to objects dynamically

5. Facade
a single class that represents an entire subsystem

6. Flyweight
a fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

7. Proxy
an object representing another object, provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

Behavioral

1. Chain of Responsibility
a way of passing a request between a chain of objects, avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving
more than one object a chance to handle the request, chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain
until an object handles it

2. Command
encapsulate a command request as an object, or create objects which encapsulate actions and parameters

3. Interpreter
a way to include language elements in a program, map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar, and the grammar
to a hierarchical object oriented design or given a language define a representation for its grammar along with an
interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language

4. Iterator
sequentially access the elements of a collection or provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

5. Mediator
defines simplified communication between classes, or promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently 

6. Memento
capture and restore an object's internal state 

7. Observer
a way of notifying change to a number of classes, define a one to many dependency between objects so that when
one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
