root ng serve
we must learn the technologies forwards and backwards ... 
this is world class https://www.yearofmoo.com/ a model in humanity and technology :)
get inspired and build an app, then build another one ...
the family is together: node, javascript, v8, c++
recommended javascript engine client side, server side => v8 is on es7
to explore: investigate test driven development in javascript and unit testing

Creational
1. Singleton
a class of which only a single instance can exist

2. Abstract factory
create an instance of several families of classes

3. Factory method
creates an instance of several derived classes

4. Builder
separates object construction from its representation

5. Prototype
a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

Structural

1. Adapter
match interfaces of different classes

2. Bridge
separates an object's interface from its implementation

3. Composite
a tree structure of simple and composite objects

4. Decorator
add responsibilities to objects dynamically

5. Facade
